/// transmits it to the terminal as a kitty image displayed through Unicode
/// placeholder cells, or paints half-blocks. Re-renders only when the image,
/// view, display params or geometry change.
///
/// With kitty and a `ready` callback, rendering and encoding happen on the
/// slot's own thread: a draw that needs a new picture asks for it and keeps
/// showing the previous one; `ready` fires (on that thread) once it is
/// encoded, and the next draw sends it. Slots then encode in parallel and the
/// UI thread only writes finished escapes. prepareAhead() starts on the next
/// playback frame before it is due, so its draw finds it done. Without
/// `ready`, or in half-block mode, a draw renders in place.
