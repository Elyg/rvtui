# Check naming (.clang-tidy's readability-identifier-naming) across the tree.
#
# `just format-check` covers layout only: whitespace, braces, include order.
# Naming (m_ members, CamelCase types, camelBack functions, UPPER_CASE
# globals and constants) needs clang-tidy, which clangd already runs in the
# editor. This is the same check from the command line, with every other
# clang-tidy check off, so it stays fast (a few seconds, in parallel).
#
# clang-tidy needs each file's compile flags, so only files in the build's
# compile_commands.json are checked: the sources and tests.
